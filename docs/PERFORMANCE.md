# Performance — long-black

Measured numbers from a full real-data build (P1.04 smoke). Update these when the
hardware, dataset size, or pipeline shape changes materially.

| Source   | ABR ABN Bulk Extract, `abn-bulk-extract`, extract **2026.06.24**          |
| Input    | 2 ZIP parts (~986 MB compressed) → 20 XML files (~13 GB)                  |
| Output   | **20,295,936** documents (one per ABN)                                    |

The ABR extract has grown past the original ~15M estimate — **20.3M** ABNs as of
2026.06.24 — which is what first exercised the >16.7M code paths (see Notes).

## Stage timings

End-to-end on the machine above (single run; wall-clock):

| Stage                            | Time        | Peak RSS   | Notes                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Download + extract               | ~2 min 12 s | —          | 2 ZIPs (~986 MB) → 20 XML files (~13 GB)                        |
| Load (saxes XML → COPY)          | ~1 min 52 s | **144 MB** | 20,295,936 records, ~181k rec/s, one streaming COPY             |
| Finalize (PK + indexes)          | ~9 s        | —          | `ALTER TABLE … ADD PRIMARY KEY` + indexes after load            |
| Flatten + verify                 | ~2 min 3 s  | **229 MB** | cursor(500) stream → NDJSON, ~165k docs/s; 0 composition errors |
| Output (split + gzip + metadata) | ~1 min 48 s | —          | per-state NDJSON, streaming gzip, `metadata.json`               |
| **Total**                        | **~8 min**  | **229 MB** | from cold download to per-state `.ndjson.gz`                    |

Peak RSS across the whole pipeline is **229 MB** — comfortably under the **500 MB**
budget. Memory is flat with respect to row count: the load holds only the current
`<ABR>`, the flatten streams via a server-side cursor, and verify uses
sorted-adjacency id checks (no per-row accumulation).

## Output

Per-state split, streaming gzip (one file per `state`; `other` bucket for
null/empty state; `AAT`, when present, is its own bucket — this extract had none):

`metadata.json` records the per-state counts, the build timestamp, and the CC-BY
3.0 AU source attribution.

## Enrichment (real extract, 2026.06.24)

All ten enrichment sources were loaded against the real 20.3M-ABN table (seven CSVs
from data.gov.au; AusTender from the OCP Data Registry; two ATO XLSX workbooks), then
joined through `abn_full.sql`. Measured on the machine above; the enrichment joins
together add ~15 s to the flatten and stay well under the memory budget. The
AusTender aggregation (851k OCDS releases → 52,800 per-ABN rows) streams in constant
memory; the XLSX sources are tiny (<1 MB each) and parse in-memory.

| Source                          | Rows loaded | ABNs enriched | Coverage | Join key            |
| ------------------------------- | ----------: | ------------: | -------: | ------------------- |
| ASIC Company                    |   2,342,141 |     2,341,897 |   11.5 % | ABN                 |
| ASIC Business Names             |   2,618,824 |     1,977,574 |    9.7 % | ABN (holder)        |
| ACNC charities                  |      65,270 |        65,265 |    0.3 % | ABN                 |
| ACNC AIS financials             |      53,665 |        51,806 |    0.3 % | ABN (into charity)  |
| ASIC AFS Licensees              |       6,464 |         6,315 |  0.031 % | ABN **or** ACN      |
| ASIC Credit Licensees           |       4,296 |         3,943 |  0.019 % | ABN **or** ACN      |
| ASIC Banned & Disqualified Orgs |          15 |            12 | <0.001 % | ACN (`asic_number`) |
| AusTender govSpend              |      52,800 |        52,779 |    0.3 % | ABN (supplier)      |
| ATO Corporate Tax Transparency  |       4,162 |         4,119 |  0.020 % | ABN                 |
| ATO R&D Tax Incentive           |      13,133 |        13,019 |  0.064 % | ABN **or** ACN      |

ABNs-enriched is the document count carrying a non-null `company` /
`financialServicesLicence` / `creditLicence` / `charity` / `govSpend` (or
`charity.financials` for the AIS row) or a non-empty `registeredBusinessNames[]` /
`bannedDisqualified[]`; it matches the output exactly (0 composition errors, 0
duplicate `_id` over 20,295,936 docs). Most ABNs
are sole traders / trusts with no ASIC or ACNC record, so the low coverage is
expected, not a gap — the regulated & risk registers are deliberately small
populations (licensed financial-services providers and ASIC enforcement actions).

> **AIS coverage = charity ∩ AIS.** `charity.financials` populates only when the
> ABN is in _both_ the current charity register and the AIS (financials fold into
> `charity{}`). On the 2024 AIS that intersection is **51,806** (of 53,665 filers;
> the other 1,859 had deregistered and carry no financials). The AIS is pinned to
> the 2024 package — a reproducible snapshot, bumped annually.

> **AFS/credit ABN-vs-ACN keying + the `undetermined` guard.** The `*_ABN_ACN`
> source column holds an 11-digit ABN on most rows but a 9-digit ACN on some
> (2026.06.24: **6,300 ABN + 164 ACN** for AFS; **3,939 ABN + 357 ACN** for credit).
> The ACN path resolves those via `a.asic_number`, recovering the rows the ABN-only
> path dropped (AFS 6,300 → **6,315**, credit 3,939 → **3,943** — only the ACN rows
> whose ACN actually appears as an ABR `asic_number` resolve). Crucially, the real
> ABR extract types **every** `asic_number` as `'undetermined'` (never
> ACN/ARBN/ARSN/ARFN), so the ACN-path joins **exclude** known foreign types
> (`ARBN`/`ARSN`/`ARFN`) rather than require `ACN` — a `= 'ACN'` guard matched
> nothing and zeroed `bannedDisqualified` across all 20.3M docs (the 20.3M proof
> caught this; the fixture now seeds `undetermined` to lock it in). With the
> exclusion guard, `bannedDisqualified` is back to **12**.

> **govSpend (AusTender).** The OCP bulk `full.jsonl.gz` (851k OCDS releases) loaded
> in one streaming pass to **52,800** distinct supplier ABNs (one release per ocid;
> a defensive ocid de-dup guard is kept). **52,779** of those join the 20.3M ABR base
> (the other 21 supplier ABNs aren't in the extract). Aggregate face value across all
> history (2004→2026): **AUD ~1.20 trillion**; busiest supplier has **22,727**
> contracts. Values are summed in integer cents for an exact, order-deterministic
> total.

**Completeness gates** (the "data must be complete before shipping" policy):

- `enrich-cli` fails if any source loads below its floor (`minRows`: company/
  business-names 1,000,000, charities 20,000, AIS 20,000, AFS/credit 1,000, banned
  5, AusTender suppliers 30,000, tax-transparency 2,000, R&D 5,000 — ≈⅓ of the
  counts above, except the tiny volatile banned register whose floor just catches a
  0-row/wrong-file load).
- `cli.js` runs an enrichment-coverage gate after verify
  (`LONG_BLACK_COVERAGE_PROFILE=production`): the build fails unless `company` ≥
  1,000,000, `registeredBusinessNames` ≥ 1,000,000, `charity` ≥ 20,000,
  `charityFinancials` ≥ 20,000, `financialServicesLicence` ≥ 1,000,
  `creditLicence` ≥ 1,000, `bannedDisqualified` ≥ 5, `govSpend` ≥ 30,000,
  `taxTransparency` ≥ 2,000, and `rdTaxIncentive` ≥ 5,000 docs.
- `build.yml` treats an incomplete enrichment as fatal (no silent partial
  release) unless a deliberate `allow_partial_enrichment=true` manual override,
  and diffs the build against the prior release (`compare-cli`) to hold anomalous
  builds as drafts.

## Data-quality observations (real extract)

- **ABN checksum:** all 20,295,936 `_id`s pass the mod-89 weighted checksum (0
  failures).
- **Uniqueness:** 0 duplicate `_id`s; the post-load `ADD PRIMARY KEY` did not trip
  the dedup fallback (each ABN appears once across the 20 files).
- **Names equal to type codes:** 7 documents have a name field whose value equals
  an XML discriminator code — all genuine (e.g. `DGR`/`BN` as people's initials in
  a trading name, `IND`/`TRD` as real registered names), not a parse leak. See the
  note in `src/verify-checks.ts`.

## Notes

- **>16.7M is a real threshold, not theoretical.** At 20.3M docs the verify
  harness's original id-uniqueness Set both exceeded V8's ~16.7M-entry cap
  (`RangeError: Set maximum size exceeded`) and consumed ~3 GB RSS. crema's
  `verify` now takes `idsSorted` (the flatten emits `ORDER BY abn`), detecting
  duplicates by adjacency in O(1) memory — which is what keeps the flatten+verify
  stage at 229 MB above.
- **Reproduce:** `LONG_BLACK_VERSION=2026.06.24 ./scripts/build-local.sh` (needs
  Docker + ~15 GB free disk for the extract). The fixture loop
  (`./scripts/build-fixture-only.sh`) covers the pipeline shape in <30 s without a
  download.
